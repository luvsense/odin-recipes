        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped strawberry Pop-Tarts (about 4 Pop-Tarts)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white chocolate chips (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang for easy removal.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Gently fold in the chopped strawberry Pop-Tarts and white chocolate chips, if using, until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter evenly into the prepared baking pan, smoothing the top with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the blondies are golden brown around the edges and set in the center.</li>
        <li>Allow the blondies to cool completely in the pan before slicing into squares. Enjoy these delightful Strawberry Pop-Tart Blondies as a sweet treat any time of day!</li>
